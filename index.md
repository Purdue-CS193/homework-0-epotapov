# Edward Potapov's First CS193 Homework

## Things I like about CS193:
- I like that CS193 showed me the Student Developer Pack. 
- I also enjoy that CS193 exposed me to markdown a very useful thing for creating READMEs.
- I find it very helpful that CS193 is taught by students.
- I had a lot of fun doing this homework assignment and cannot wait for more.
